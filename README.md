FBEvents Module for DNN

FBEvents is a DNN Module to enable leveraging the core DNN Events module for scheduling and reporting of volunteers for a non-profit organization.

The DNN FBEvents Schedule Manager module is an extension for the core DNN Events module. If you were to think of "Events" as "Shifts", by enabling enrollment on events, users can sign up themselves for available shifts that need to be filled for an organization.

The DNN Events Schedule Manager enables authorized users to manage signups for shifts created in the DNN Events calendar. It also provides for reporting on shifts for who's signed up and which shifts have openings that need to be filled.

Volunteer Scheduling Module Features:

  - Shift Enrollment Detail Report - See who's scheduled for shifts over a date range
  - Shift Shortage Report - See what shifts need filling
  - Manage Registered Users Schedule
